Tweet2Vec
======================
This repository provides a character-level encoder/trainer for social media posts. See [Tweet2Vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03481) paper for details.

There are two models implemented in the paper - the character level _tweet2vec_ and a word level baseline. They can be found in their respective directories, with instructions on how to run. General information about prerequisites and data format can be found below.

## Prerequisites
 * Conda: https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html

## Installation
1. create  `tweet2vec`-conda environment
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
1. activate `tweet2vec` environment
   ```
   source activate tweet2vec
   ```
1. try fixing lasagne issue: https://github.com/Theano/Theano/issues/4337
   ```
   ./fix_theano_issue_4337.sh
   ```
1. run code ...

Data and Preprocessing
=======================
Unfortunately we are not allowed to release the data used in experiments from the paper, due to licensing restrictions. Hence, we describe the data format and preprocessing here -

1. __Preprocessing__ - We replace HTML tags, usernames, and URLs from tweet text with special tokens. Hashtags are also removed from the body of a tweet, and re-tweets are discarded. Example code is provided in `misc/preprocess.py`. 

2. __Encoding File Format__ - If you have a bunch of posts that you want to embed into a vector space, use the `_encoder.sh` scripts provided. The input file must contain one tweet per line (make sure you preprocess these first). An example is provided in `misc/encoder_example.txt`.

3. __Training File Format__ - To train the models from scratch, use the `_trainer.sh` scripts provided. The input file must contain one _(hashtag,tweet)_ pair per line separated by a tab. There should be only one tag per line - for tweets with multiple tags split them into separate line. See `misc/trainer_example.txt` for an example. 

4. __Test/Validation File Format__ - After training the model, you can test it on a held-out set using `_tester.sh` scripts provided. It has the same format as the training file format, except it can have multiple tags per separated by a comma. Example in `misc/tester_example.txt`.

Note
==========================
Make sure to add `THEANO_FLAGS=device=cpu,floatX=float32` before any command if you are running on a CPU.
